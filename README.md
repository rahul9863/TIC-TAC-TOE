# TIC-TAC-TOE

This is the complete CPP codes for classic Game TIC TAC TOE using wxwidgets class Library.
It is Human vs Human (i.e 2 Player) game with added Graphics using Wxwidgets and response on Mouse click.
As the size is not reactive :P , just play in the size available. It is good or enough for the window display.
